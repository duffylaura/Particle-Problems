We want a reliable, easy/enjoyable to use app that tells the user the pollen count and the air quality in their location (or the location they choose to search). 

Like light coming through a window in a dusty room, we want to illuminate how many particles are in the air in a simple way for anyone, but especially for those with asthma, allergies, and other conditions in which high particle count in the air is a struggle. 

Our application will provide a solution to those with Particle Problems in one click, instead of several Googles per day.
